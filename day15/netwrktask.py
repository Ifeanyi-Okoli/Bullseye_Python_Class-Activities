#Client Vs Server Architecture
#What is networking.
#PAN is extablsihing connection between ports, systems within a device
#Topology is the arrangement of thesse systems: sTRAR, BUS, MESH, RING, TREE topologies
#LAN is establishing connection between devices within a room
#WAN is establishing connection between devices across the world
#MAN is establishing connection between devices within a city
#WLAN is establishing connection between devices within a building
#There are several protocols of connection between devices
#File Server
#We use Python module called sockets to establish connection between devices
#We use Python module called socketserver to establish connection between devices
#We use Python module called http.server to establish connection between devices
#We use Python module called http.client to establish connection between devices
#We use Python module called urllib to establish connection between devices
#We use Python module called urllib.request to establish connection between devices
#We use Python module called urllib.parse to establish connection between devices
#We use Python module called urllib.error to establish connection between devices
#We use Python module called urllib.robotparser to establish connection between devices
#socket.io 
#socket.io-client
#Socket family: AF_INET, AF_UNIX
#Socket type: SOCK_STREAM, or SOCK_GRAM
#Socket protocol: 0, or IPPROTO_TCP

#TCP vs UDP 
#UDP is very fast and reliable. It is a secured protocol that. Data is encryptted
# SOCK_STREAM is for TCP and SOCK_DGRAM is for UDP
#TCP is a connection oriented protocol. It is a secured protocol that. Data is encryptted
